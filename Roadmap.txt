🚀 XecureVault Roadmap
1️⃣ Setup & Initialization (🔹 Day 1)
✅ Create GitHub Repo & set up project structure.

Passwords Collection (Encrypted passwords linked to users).
2️⃣ Authentication System (🔹 Day 1-2)

4️⃣ Advanced Features (🔹 Day 3-4)
✅ Add Password Generator (customizable length & complexity).

✅ Sync passwords across devices (data stored in Firestore).

5️⃣ Final Testing & Deployment (🔹 Day 4-5)
✅ Optimize UI & fix bugs.
✅ Deploy frontend on Firebase Hosting / Vercel.
✅ Ensure secure database rules (users can only access their own passwords).
✅ Add GitHub integration for version control.

🔥 Future Enhancements (Later Updates)
🔹 Security Insights (Weak password detection).
🔹 Two-Factor Authentication (Extra login security).
🔹 Emergency Access (Trusted contact for password recovery).
